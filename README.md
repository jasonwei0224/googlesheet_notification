## General info
This script is used in Google App Script in Google Sheets. I created this script when I was working at 
Asian-Canadian Special Events Association. The idea is that various of request for purchase are submitted by employees
each day. It is hard to keep track without having a place collecting all the requests. So a Google Sheet was created to 
keep track of it. And, to save time for management so that they dont need to go on the sheet everyday just to check if there's a submission
I created this script so that it will send email when a new purchase request is submitted, in addition if a purchase request 
is approved or rejected, the requestee will be notified by email.
